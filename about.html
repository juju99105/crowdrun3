                  We are a community-driven running website that empowers users to discover and share their preferred
                  running routes
                  freely. Our platform offers an accessible database where enthusiasts can search for paths based on
                  location, distance,
                  and difficulty level. Members can contribute their own routes, enriching our collectiveresource. Our
                  service is entirely free, sustained by the generous support of donation and the devotion of our
                  admins.</p>

               <h4 class="reason1Title">Promote Accessibility</h4>
               <p class="reason1">We believe that everyone should have free access to quality running routes without the
                  barrier of a paywall, which is
                  increasingly common in other running apps.</p>

                  advice, thereby fostering a supportive
                  community of like-minded individuals.</p>

                  outdoors and engage in physical
                  activity, which is beneficial for both physical and mental health.</p>

                  discovered otherwise, broadening their
                  horizons and enriching their running experience.</p>
